## create a Slack app in Javascript or Python with the following requirements:
1. Create a new Slack workspace with two channels named “Channel 1” and “Channel 2”
2. Create a slash command [https://api.slack.com/interactivity/slash-commands] “/forward” to echo any message sent in Channel 1 to Channel 2 in upper case. For example, if the message sent in Channel 1 was “/forward Hello World”, it should automatically send “HELLO WORLD” in Channel 2.
